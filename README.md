# million-bot
It's a discord bot that moderates the count-to-a-million channel, very cool.

# what?
My friend John has a discord C++ server ( https://discord.gg/DpfjXdaZ ) where in one of the channels the goal is to count to a million, one person at a time. This bot will act as an automaderator for it that collects stats and automatically manages messages sent to the counting channel.
